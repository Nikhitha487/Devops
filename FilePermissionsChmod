###   chmod is a command in Unix-like operating systems used to change the file system modes or permissions of files and directories. 
Understanding how to use chmod is crucial for managing file permissions and controlling access to files on your system.


#   Owner (User who owns the file)
Group (Users who are in the file's group)
Others (Everyone else)

permissions are represented by a three-digit number. Each digit is a sum of permissions:

4 = read (r)
2 = write (w)
1 = execute (x)


r       “read” the file’s contents. 
w	    “write”, or modify, the file’s contents. 
x    	“execute” the file. This permission is given only if the file is a program.


7 = 4 + 2 + 1 = rwx
6 = 4 + 2 = rw-
5 = 4 + 1 = r-x
4 = r--
3 = 2 + 1 = wx-
2 = w--
1 = x--
0 = ---



example :

chmod 755 file.txt

rwxr-xr-x 
owner has full access, group and others have read and execute access
